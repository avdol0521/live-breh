- we get weird stuff from this 
```sh
fe `_` ``e bh ``d ba `_h hf `_f `_` ba ``e `_c `_d ``d ba hf ba hg `_d ``e ba ``e ``c `_d hh `_f `_d `_` ``c ce ce ce
```
- weird = ROT47 so lets try that:
- yup. got decimal code from that
```sh
76 101 116 39 115 32 109 97 107 101 32 116 104 105 115 32 97 32 98 105 116 32 116 114 105 99 107 105 101 114 46 46 46
```
- finally -\_\_-
- `Let's make this a bit trickier...`
# T2: `Spectrograms`
- downloaded the `wav` file. lets put it into Sonic Visualiser and see what comes up: <br>
![[c4ptur3-th3-fl4gSpectrogramSS.png]]
- nice. `Super Secret Message`
# T3: `Steganography`
- downloaded the image <br>
![[c4ptur3-th3-fl4gStegoSteg.jpg.png]]
- lets see what this stego is hiding :D

- damn more nested binwalk stuff -\_\_-
- got another file called `97.zlib`. idk how to decompress that actually. lets look it up. 
- tried it with [[zlib-flate]]. didnt work. lets do strings again on this new one to see if theres anything in it
- yup there it is -,- that was a total wild goose chase
